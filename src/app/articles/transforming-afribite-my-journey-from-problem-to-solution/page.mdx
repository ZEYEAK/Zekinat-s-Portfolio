I joined the [**HerTechTrail**](https://www.hertechtrail.org/) program with one goal: to transform my passion for product management into a skill that could create a real impact. From day one, the learning experience was intense yet enriching. My mentors challenged me to think critically, design creatively, and most importantly, embrace the process of building something from the ground, up.

**Learning Moments:**

- Understanding the fundamentals of problem-solving from a product management perspective
- Gaining hands-on experience with tools like Jira, Confluence, and product road mapping

# **Starting from Zero: The Problem Space**

For my capstone project, I was to work on a food delivery service website “AfriBite”. My mission was to build a platform that addressed common pain points for food lovers, such as:

**The Problem Became Clear:**

- **Food Lovers**: Difficulty finding African restaurants and authentic dishes
- **Restaurant Owners**: Lack of visibility and customer reach

I needed to create a product that not only solved these issues but also provided a seamless and delightful user experience.

With a vision in place, I began mapping out Afribite’s journey. I focused on three core objectives:

1.  **Creating an easy-to-use platform** for discovering African restaurants
2.  **Offering tools for restaurant owners** to list their businesses and manage orders
3.  **Building a user-friendly website** that caters to both food lovers and restaurant owners

My training at HerTechTrail provided me with the tools to break down these goals into actionable steps, and I started working on Afribite’s Minimum Viable Product (MVP).

With a clear problem statement in mind, I began designing Afribite, focusing on creating a user-friendly experience for both customers and restaurant owners. The design process was an exciting journey of bringing ideas to life:

- **Homepage**: Crafted to showcase featured African dishes and restaurants, providing a welcoming experience
- **Search Feature**: Designed to enable users to find restaurants by location, cuisine type, or specific dishes
- **Authentication, Login & Sign-Up**: Ensuring a smooth onboarding process for both food lovers and restaurant owners

I worked closely with Figma and the Lucid app, translating user stories into wireframes, prototypes, and high-fidelity designs. Every element was designed with scalability in mind, ensuring the platform could grow as more features were introduced.

**Design Principles Applied:**

- **Simplicity**: Ensuring that users can easily navigate the platform
- **Visual Appeal**: Using vibrant colours and imagery to reflect the richness of African cuisine
- **Responsiveness**: Designing for both desktop and mobile experiences

The design process was not without its challenges:

1.  **Balancing User Needs**: Ensuring that the platform catered to both food lovers and restaurant owners required constant iteration.
2.  **Creating an Intuitive Search Experience**: I had to refine the search filters multiple times to make sure users could easily find what they were looking for.
3.  **Design Consistency**: Maintaining a cohesive design across different pages was a challenge, but it taught me the importance of design systems and guidelines.

By embracing these challenges, I was able to fine-tune Afribite’s design, creating a cohesive and user-friendly platform ready for the next stage of development.

The design phase was just the beginning. As Afribite moves into development, I’m excited to see how the platform will evolve. Here’s a sneak peek into what’s next:

- **Development**: Turning designs into a fully functional website
- **User Testing**: Gathering feedback from restaurant owners and food lovers to refine the platform
- **Launch**: Introducing Afribite to the world as the go-to platform for African cuisine in the UK This would involve:

**\-Creating a Design Handoff Document**: Detailing every element, component, and interaction for the developers to implement

**\-Setting Up User Flows**: Mapping out the journey for both restaurant owners and food lovers to ensure a seamless experience

**\-Preparing for Integration**: Outlining the APIs and backend structures needed to support Afribite’s features

These steps are to ensure that when development begins, the process will be as smooth and efficient as possible, with a clear vision and detailed roadmap.

My journey with Afribite through [**HerTechTrail**](https://www.hertechtrail.org/) taught me invaluable lessons about the design process and product management:

- **The Importance of User Feedback**: Constantly testing designs with potential users helped refine Afribite’s features.
- **Embracing Iteration**: Each design challenge provided an opportunity to iterate and improve.
- **Collaboration is Key**: Working with mentors, developers, and other designers enhanced the quality and feasibility of the design.

Designing Afribite wasn’t just about creating wireframes or interfaces; it was about solving a real problem, embracing challenges, and growing as a product manager. The [**HerTechTrail**](https://www.hertechtrail.org/) experience equipped me with the skills and mindset to take an idea from concept to design — and soon, from design to reality.
